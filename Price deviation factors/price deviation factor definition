Using the CSI 500 Index as an example, take the post-adjusted closing prices of the constituents of the CSI 500 Index over the past 250 trading days. 

Processes:

1.Calculate the price changes and the Pearson correlation coefficient for the 250-day price changes. 
Define the "distance between stocks" as 1 minus the Pearson correlation coefficient to determine the "distance" between each pair of stocks in the CSI 500.
2.For each stock, extract the distances to the 10 stocks that are closest in terms of this metric, and create an equally-weighted portfolio of these 10 stocks as a characteristic portfolio. 
Calculate the net value price of this characteristic portfolio to serve as a reference price (ReferencePrice).
3.Subtract the log of the reference price from the log of the closing price (StockPrice) of each stock in the CSI 500 to get the logarithmic price difference (PriceSpread).
4.For each stock, calculate the PriceSpread over the past 60 trading days and standardize it to get SpreadBias.(normalization)

This factor essentially measures the deviation of a stock's price relative to a portfolio of stocks with similar characteristics. It acts as a relative mean-reversion factor. A low SpreadBias indicates that the stock has underperformed its characteristic portfolio in the recent past, implying its relative valuation is low and suggesting a potential to revert upwards, thus expecting positive excess returns.
